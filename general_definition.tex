\section{General Definitions}
\label{sec:general-defn}
In this section, we design a general security definition for MPMs. Our definition shares many similarities with Canetti and Krawczyk's foundational CK models \cite{CK2001keyexchange}, which define the security of key exchange protocols over untrusted channels. However, we find it difficult to directly adapt the CK models, especially the authenticated-links(AM) model, to account for metadata privacy. Therefore, we design our security definition from scratch.

We start from the following basic principles.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The messaging system has a centralized server in charge of storing and routing messages. We do not consider decentralized messaging systems in this paper.
    \item The messaging system has a large number of users, interacting with "client" software on their computers. The client software should allow the user to register, add friends, and send messages at any time. It should display received messages to the user.
    \item The messaging system should hide metadata of conversations between honest users from a powerful adversary that controls the server, the network, and a subset of clients. 
    \item The messaging system should be reasonably robust. As long as the server functions normally, even if the adversary compromises some users, it should not disrupt conversations between honest users.
\end{enumerate}
We now translate these principles into mathematical definitions that apply to a general messaging system.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-timestep}
A \textbf{timestep} is our system's basic unit of time. We assume that the system starts on timestep $t = 1$. Methods are executed on positive integer timesteps.

The timestep is different from ``rounds" used in most MPM security definitions, since clients do not necessarily transmit real or fake messages at every timestep. Instead, a timestep plays a similar role as a clock cycle in computer hardware â€” think of it as being 1 nanosecond. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-client-view}
The \textbf{view} of a client is a tuple $(\cF, \cM)$ consisting of

1. A list of friends $\cF$ of the client.

2. A list of messages $\cM$ received by the client, including the sender and content of the messages.
\end{definition}
\textbf{Remark}: For simplicity, the view does not include messages sent by the client. The GUI can simply store such messages locally and display them to the user.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-user-input}
A \textbf{user input} is a command the user can issue to the client. In our current protocol, it can take one of the following values.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\emptyset$: noop.
    \item $\trust(\reg)$: Add the user identified by $\reg$ as a friend, and enable the two parties to start a conversation.
    \item $\send(\reg, \msg)$: Send the message $\msg$ to the client identified by $\reg$. We assume that $\msg$ always has a constant length $L_{\msg}$.\footnote{For simplicity, we assume this holds even for adversarial inputs.}
\end{itemize}

Without loss of generality, we assume each user issues exactly one input per timestep.
\end{definition}
\textbf{Remark}:  In our implementation, we take $L_{\msg} \approx 1\mathsf{KB}$. To support variable length messages, we pad short messages and split long messages into chunks of length $L_{\msg}$. This modification does not affect our security definition below.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-registration-info}
The \textbf{registration information}, denoted $\reg$ in this paper, is the unique identifier of a user.
\end{definition}
\textbf{Remark: }Throughout the rest of the paper, we will always use the registration info as the "address" in the messaging system. For example, we will use registration info as the argument in the make-friend and send-message methods. Registration info is ubiquitous in practical messaging systems: in Messenger, it is the Facebook handle. In Signal, it is the phone number. In Anysphere, it is the ``public ID" as defined in \cite[Figure 6]{whitepaper}.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-scheme}
A \textbf{Messaging System} consists of the following polynomial time algorithms.

Client Side Algorithms for the stateful client $C$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $C.\Register(1^{\lambda}, i, N) \to \reg$. This algorithm is called once for each client upon registration. It takes in a security parameter $\lambda$, the index $i$ of the client, the total number of users $N$, and outputs a public registration info $\reg$. It also initializes client storage and states.
    
    \item $C.\Userinput(t, \cI) \to \req$. This algorithm handles a user input $\cI$. It updates the client storage to reflect the new input, then issues a (possibly empty) request $\req$ to the server.
    
    \item $C.\Serverrpc(t, \resp)$. This algorithm handles the server's response $\resp$ and updates client storage.
    
    \item $C.\mathsf{GetView}() \to V$. This algorithm outputs the client's view (\cref{defn:messaging-client-view}). Its output is passed to the GUI and displayed to the user.
\end{itemize}

Server Side Algorithms for the stateful server $S$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S.\mathsf{InitServer}(1^{\lambda}, N)$. This algorithm takes in the security parameter $\lambda$, the number of clients $N$, and initializes the server-side database $D_S$.
    \item $S.\Clientrpc(t, \{\req_i\}_{i = 1}^N) \to \{\resp_i\}_{i = 1}^N$. This algorithm responds to all client requests $\req_i$ the server received on a given timestep $t$. It outputs the responses $\resp_i$ that get sent back to the client.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


Now we can describe some desired properties of MPM systems. In the rest of this section, we will look at three properties we wish Anysphere to satisfy: Correctness, Metadata privacy, and Integrity.

\subsection{Correctness}
\label{subsec:messaging-correctness}
First, we describe how the server and clients interact when the server behaves honestly. We call this scenario the Honest Server Experiment. To enforce robustness, we let an adversary control a subset of users and passively monitor all conversations.

\begin{definition}  \hfill\\
\label{defn:messaging-honest-server-experiment}
The honest server experiment takes the following parameters.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\lambda$, the security parameter.
    \item $N = N(\lambda)$, the number of clients, a polynomially-bounded function of $\lambda$.
    \item $T = T(\lambda)$, the number of timesteps, a polynomially-bounded function of $\lambda$.
    \item For each client $i \in [N]$ and timestep $t \in [T]$, a user input $\cI_{i, t}$.
    \item A set of honest clients $\cH \subset [N]$.
    \item A stated p.p.t adversary $\cA$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $S$ denote the server machine, and let $\{C_i\}_{i \in \cH}$ denote the honest client machines. The experiment is described below.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{framed}
\textbf{Honest Server Experiment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S.\mathsf{InitServer}(1^{\lambda}, N)$. 
\item For each $i \in \cH$, $\reg_i \leftarrow C_i.\Register(1^{\lambda}, i, N)$. 
\item For $t$ from $1$ to $T$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For each $i \in \cH$, $\req_i \leftarrow C_i.\Userinput(t, \cI)$.

    \item $\{\req_i\}_{i \in [N] - \cH} \leftarrow \cA(\{\req_i\}_{i \in \cH})$.
    
    \item $\{\resp_i\} \leftarrow S.\Clientrpc(t, \{\req_i\})$.
    
    \item For each $i \in \cH$, $C_i.\Serverrpc(t, \resp_i)$.

    \item $\cA$ stores $\{\resp_i\}_{i \in [N]}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}

\end{figure}

\end{definition}

% Resolved
%\arvid{Do we want an adversary to be able to control some of the clients? Ideally, I think we would want to because we want to guarantee resistance against denial of service attacks from clients}
%\stzh{Good idea. I'll return to this after finishing the security proof in the current iteration.}

In this case, we expect the client's view to be "correct". We first need to define what "correct" means here. Informally speaking, the correct view should satisfy
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The list of friends contains the friends we called $\trust$ on.         
    \item Messages from friends should be present.  
    \item No other messages should be present. 
\end{enumerate}
We state the formal definition.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:client-view-correct}
Given a set of honest clients identified by $\reg_{\cH}$, and user inputs $\{\cI_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}$, a view $(\cF_j, \cM_j)$ of client $j$ is \textbf{correct} if it satisfies
\begin{multline*}
\cF_j \cap \reg_{\cH} = \{\reg_k: k \in \cH, \exists t \in [T], \trust(\reg_k) = \cI_{j, t}\},    
\end{multline*}
and, for each honest user $k \in \cH$
\begin{align*}
     &\{\msg: &&(\reg_k, \msg) \subset \cM_j\} \\
      =& \{\msg: &&\exists t \in [T], \send(\reg_j, \msg) = \cI_{k, t} \land \\
          &   &&\exists t' < t, \trust(\reg_j) = \cI_{k, t'} \land \\
          &   &&\exists t'' \in [T], \trust(\reg_k) = \cI_{j, t''}\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\textbf{Remark}: We comment on some subtleties implied by this definition.

1) The definition allows $\cF$ to contain registration info not corresponding to any client. We can rule out these "ghost" friends by sending each friend a "hello message" and waiting for an ACK before including the friend in a view. 

2) If user $k$ tries to send user $j$ a message before user $j$ adds user $k$ as a friend, user $j$ should be able to receive the message.

Since the GUI can query the client at any time, we expect the client's view to be ``correct" all the time. There is a caveat: due to the lack of synchronous rounds, the clients do not immediately read all messages sent by their friends. Thus, the strongest correctness notion of sequential consistency might not be satisfied. Instead, we settle for a pair of weaker consistency models defined in \cite{doug13Consistency}. 
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-correctness}
 We say a messaging system is \textbf{correct} if for any choice of parameters of the honest server experiment, any $j \in \cH$, and any positive integer $T_0 \leq T$. Let $V_j \leftarrow C_j.\mathsf{GetView}()$ be the view of client $j$ after timestep $T_0$ of the Honest Server Experiment, the messaging system satisfies the following two properties with probability $1 - \negl(\lambda)$.

1) \textbf{Consistent Prefix}: $V$ is identical to the correct view of the client $j$ if a prefix of user inputs have been executed on each client machine. More formally, for any $j \in \cH$, there exists a map $t: \cH \to [T_0]$ such that  $V$ is a correct view of client $j$ with honest users $\reg_{\cH}$ and inputs $\{\cI'_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}$, where we define
$$\cI'_{i, t} = \begin{cases}
\cI_{i, t}, t \leq t(i) \\
\emptyset, t > t(i)
\end{cases}.$$
2) \textbf{Eventual Consistency}: For any $T_1$, there is a polynomial function $T_{cons} = T_{cons}(N, T_1)$ such that if $T_0 \geq T_{cons}$, such that we can take $t(i) \geq T_1$ for every $i \in \cH$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Metadata Security and Integrity}
\label{subsec:messaging-security-integrity}
Next, we define security with an active adversary. We first recap our threat model, defined in \cite[Section 2.2]{whitepaper}. We enable the adversary to

1) Control all servers and the entire internet. In the definition below, the adversary read all requests from honest clients, computes any polynomial time function over them, and returns any response to each client. Therefore, the adversary can perform most record-layer attacks considered by the security community, such as eavesdropping, traffic analysis, and active attacks like cut-and-paste, deep packet inspection, and replay attacks \cite{DB1996sslsecurity}.

2) Control any subset of the users. In the definition below, the adversary can compromise the friends of honest clients and schedule conversations with honest clients. This allows the adversary to launch the CF attacks defined in \cite{angel2018cf} and \cref{sec:security-vulnerable}.

We do not enable the adversary to

1) Access or launch side-channel attacks on client machines such as timing attacks and Spectre \cite{Spectre}. We assume timing data and the intermediate state of client execution are invisible to the adversary.

2) Break standard cryptography. In \cref{sec:asphr-defn}, we describe standard security requirements on the cryptography primitives we use.

We write our security definitions following the real world-ideal world paradigm used in \cite[Section 2.2]{shi2021non}. On a high level, the real-world experiment is the honest world experiment with an adversarial server running arbitrary code. The ideal world experiment is the real-world experiment with crucial information "redacted". We say the messaging system is secure if the adversary's views under the two experiments are indistinguishable.

We first define the real-world experiment.

\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-real-world-experiment}
The real-world experiment uses the parameters $\lambda, N, T, \cH$ in \cref{defn:messaging-honest-server-experiment}. Let $\cA$ be a stateful p.p.t. adversary. The experiment $\Real_{\msg}^{\cA}(1^{\lambda})$ is described in \cref{expr:messaging-real-world}.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{framed}
\textbf{Real World Experiment }$\Real_{\msg}^{\cA}(1^{\lambda})$
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cH \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, N, T)$.
\item For each $i \in \cH$, $\reg_i \leftarrow C_i.\Register(1^{\lambda}, i, N)$. 
\item $\{\cI_{i, 1}\} \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, \reg_{\cH})$.
\item For $t$ from $1$ to $T$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For each $i \in H$, $\req_i \leftarrow C_i.\Userinput(t, \cI_{i, t})$.
    
    \item $\{\resp_i\}_{i \in \cH}, \{\cI_{i, t + 1}\}_{i \in \cH} \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, \{\req_i\}_{i \in \cH})$.
    
    \item For each $i \in \cH$, $C_i.\Serverrpc(t, \resp_i)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}
\caption{Real World Experiment for Messaging System}
\label{expr:messaging-real-world}
\end{figure}

We next define the ideal world experiment. As in \cite{shi2021non}, we first define the leakage, which describes the information the adversary is allowed to know. Informally, the adversary knows the time and contents of
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Trust establishment with compromised clients.
    \item Messages sent to the compromised clients.
\end{enumerate}
The formal definition is below.

\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-leakage}
Let $\reg_\cH$ be the registration info of honest clients. Let $\{\cI_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}$ be the input from honest clients. We define the \textbf{Leakage} $\mathsf{Leak}(\{\cI_{i, t}\}, \reg_{\cH})$ as
$$\Leak(\{\cI_{i, t}\}, \reg_\cH) = \{\cI_{i, t}: (i, t) \in \Leak_f \cup \Leak_m\}$$
where
$$\Leak_f = \{(i, t): \trust(\reg) = \cI_{i, t}, \reg \notin \reg_{\cH}\}.$$
$$\Leak_m = \{(i, t): \mathsf{SendMessage}(\reg, \msg) = \cI_{i, t}, \reg \notin \reg_{\cH}\}.$$
\end{definition}
% \arvid{let's use other symbols than $\cF$ and $\cM$ because we use them for the view of a single client already and this is similar but not the same}
% \stzh{Resolved.}
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-ideal-world-experiment}
We use the same parameters and notations as \cref{defn:messaging-real-world-experiment}. Furthermore, let $\Sim$ be a stateful simulator. The ideal-world experiment $\Ideal_{\msg}^{\cA, \Sim}(1^{\lambda})$ is described in \cref{expr:messaging-ideal-world}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{framed}
\textbf{Ideal World Experiment }$\Ideal_{\msg}^{\cA, \Sim}(1^{\lambda})$
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cH \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, N, T)$.
\item $\reg_{\cH} \leftarrow \Sim(1^{\lambda}, N, T)$. 
\item $\{\cI_{i, 1}\}_{i \in \cH} \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, \reg_{\cH})$.
\item For $t$ from $1$ to $T$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  $\{\req_i\}_{i \in \cH} \leftarrow \Sim(t, \mathsf{Leak}(\{\cI_{i, t}\}, \reg_{\cH}))$.
    
    \item $\{\resp_i\}_{i \in \cH}, \{\cI_{i, t + 1}\}_{i \in \cH} \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, \{\req_i\}_{i \in \cH})$.
    
    \item $\Sim(t, \{\resp_i\}_{i \in \cH})$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}
\caption{Ideal World Experiment for Messaging System}
\label{expr:messaging-ideal-world}
\end{figure}

\end{definition}

Finally, we define metadata security.

\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-security}
We say a messaging system is \textbf{SIM-metadata secure} if there exists a p.p.t simulator $\Sim$ such that for any p.p.t adversary $\cA$, the view of $\cA$ is indistinguishable in $\mathsf{Real}_{\msg}^{\cA}(1^{\lambda})$ and $\mathsf{Ideal}^{\cA, \mathsf{\Sim}}_{\msg}(1^{\lambda})$.
\end{definition}

% Arvid's notes because this confused him for several hours.
% Think of \mathcal{A} as the Distinguisher's right hand! Or, another way of saying it â€” it is an adversary *against* the Simulator, NOT the adversary that is trying to attack the system in the wild.
% Suppose X is an NSA spy (i.e., real world adversary). Then, the security definition has shown us that the Simulator is a really really good simulator â€” even when you try super hard to break it, you cannot. Hence, X's view in the real world will be the same as X's view in a world where everyone else is simulated by the Simulator. This means that X might as well be running in a vacuum, and hence cannot ever learn any information whatsoever.

The simulator-based definition is a relatively new way of writing security definitions. We include an equivalent security definition for readers more accustomed to indistinguishability-based security definitions.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-ind-experiment}
We use the same notations as in \cref{defn:messaging-ideal-world-experiment}. For parameter $b \in \{0, 1\}$, the IND experiment $\Ind_b^{\cA}$ is described in \cref{expr:messaging-IND}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{framed}
\textbf{IND Experiment} $\Ind_b^{\cA}$
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each $i \in \cH$, $\reg_i \leftarrow C_i.\Register(1^{\lambda}, i, N)$. 
\item $\{\cI^{0}_{i, 1}\}, \{\cI^{1}_{i, 1}\} \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, \reg_{\cH})$.
\item For $t$ from $1$ to $T$:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For each $i \in H$, $\req_i \leftarrow C_i.\Userinput(t, \cI^{b}_{i, t})$.
    
    \item for $b'\in \{0, 1\}$, $\{\resp^{b'}_i\}_{i \in \cH},\{\cI^{b'}_{i, t + 1}\}_{i \in \cH} \leftarrow \cA(1^{\lambda}, \{\req_i\}_{i \in \cH})$.
    
    \item For each $i \in \cH$, $C_i.\Serverrpc(t, \resp^{b}_i)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}
\caption{IND Experiment for Messaging System}
\label{expr:messaging-IND}
\end{figure}

We say the adversary $\cA$ is \textbf{admissible} if with probability $1$ we have
\begin{align*}
\Leak(\{\cI^{0}_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}, \reg_{\cH}) \\
= \Leak(\{\cI^{1}_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}, \reg_{\cH}).    
\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-IND-security}
We say a messaging system is \textbf{IND-metadata secure} if for any $N$ and $T$ polynomially bounded in $\lambda$, and any admissible adversary $\cA$, the IND experiments $\Ind_0^{\cA}$ and $\Ind_1^{\cA}$ are indistinguishable.
\end{definition}

Using the argument in \cite[Appendix A]{shi2021non}, we can show that IND-metadata security is equivalent to SIM-metadata security.

Finally, we define the notion of integrity. Informally, while a malicious server can DoS users, it shouldn't be able to forge messages  or selectively omit messages between honest users. In other words, the client must guarantee consistent prefixes in our threat model.
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-integrity}
Consider the real-world experiment in \cref{expr:messaging-real-world}. For any pair of honest users $i, j \in \cH$, define $V_j = (\cF, \cM) \leftarrow C_j.\mathsf{GetView}()$ at the end of the experiment. Then we say the messaging system \textbf{guarantees integrity} if with probability $1 - \negl(\lambda)$, there exists a $t(i) \in [T]$ such that
\begin{align*}
     &\{\msg: &&(\reg_i, \msg) \subset \cM\} \\
      =& \{\msg: &&\exists t \leq t(i), \send(\reg_j, \msg) = \cI_{i, t} \land \\
          &   &&\exists t' < t, \trust(\reg_j) = \cI_{i, t'} \land \\
          &   &&\exists t'', \trust(\reg_i) = \cI_{j, t''}\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\subsection{A weaker Security Definition}
\label{subsec:messaging-security-weaker}
Unfortunately, Anysphere does not satisfy the strong \cref{defn:messaging-security}. In fact, Angel et. al. \cite{angel2018cf} argues that this security notion is very hard to satisfy in general. For the threat model in our whitepaper \cite{whitepaper}, we argued security based on the strong assumption that no friends are compromised. In reality, this assumption cannot be guaranteed. In this section, we define a weaker security notion that allows a small number of compromised friends, yet still theoretically guarantees security.

%Resolved

%\arvid{Another path to explore here would be to create a new leak function, say LeakCF, which contains the exact information leaked for the CF attack. For example, one potentially useful leak function would be one that contains the current number of friends, or perhaps the number of friends but rounded to the nearest 10. In the worst case (such as our current prioritization case), we would leak the timing that a message actually gets sent to the server, which might be very hard to model here... Hmmmm}

%\stzh{I agree. This remains unresolved. We need to figure out what to do here.}

\begin{definition}
\label{defn:messaging-security-weaker}
We say that a set of inputs $\{\cI_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}$ satisfy \textbf{$B$-bounded friends} if for any $i \in \cH$, the set
$$\{\reg: \exists t, \trust(\reg) = \cI_{i, t}\}$$
has cardinality at most $B$.

We say a messaging scheme is correct with $B$-bounded friends if in the honest server experiment \cref{expr:messaging-honest-server}, if $\{\cI_{i, t}\}$ satisfy $B$-bounded friends, then the scheme produces the correct views with probability $1 - \negl(\lambda)$.

We say a messaging scheme is SIM-secure with $B$-bounded friends if for any polynomial upper bounds on $N$ and $T$, there exists a p.p.t simulator $\Sim$ such that for any p.p.t adversary $\cA$, the view of $\cA$ is indistinguishable in $\mathsf{Real}^{\cA}(1^{\lambda})$ and $\mathsf{Ideal}^{\cA, \mathsf{\Sim}}(1^{\lambda})$, provided that the input set $\{\cI_{i, t}\}_{i \in \cH, t \in [T]}$ satisfies $B$-bounded friends.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Remark}: The $B$-bounded friends hypothesis might be too restrictive in practice. We can modify the core protocol to not add dummy registration infos. Under this modification, we achieve the same security for users with no compromised friends. The tradeoff is that users with compromised friends are subject to CF attacks and will potentially leak their number of friends at any given time.
