We prove the security of Anysphere, a metadata-private messaging (MPM) system. Our main contributions are: (1) We describe a vulnerability of existing MPM implementations through a variation of the compromised-friend (CF) attack proposed by Angel et. al. Our attack can compromise the exact metadata of any conversations between honest users. (2) We present a security definition for MPM systems assuming compromised friends. (3) We prove that Anysphere's core protocol satisfies our security definition.
